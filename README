This app uses a grid trading strategy to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.
The orders are placed through the gemini API. The scheduler.py program
runs the function in C3PO called make_dem_trades() to place orders. The
program is automated to run every five minutes with a cronjob.

Thanks for checking it out!
